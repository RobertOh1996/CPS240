Thank you for seeing my program.

This program isn't likely to working on system without SQLITE system, so I recommand to you install sqlite IDE. I used SQLite Studio for SQLite.
To install SQLITE studio, there is only thing you have to do:
Access the link: https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt?act=download
You can download it from github release page.

If you test drag & drop into external video streaming program, you need install that. Any external video streaming program would be accepted, but I used a program which is called 'PotPlayer'. You can download it here: https://tv.kakao.com/guide/potplayer
You must know, its korean video player, so it's written as Korean.

There is no more requirement for this system. But if you have any question and need more explanation for my program, contact me:
